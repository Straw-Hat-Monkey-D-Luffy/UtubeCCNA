OSI - Open System Interconennect

7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Session
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data-Link Layer
1. Physical

TCP-IP Model
	
4. Application   -- 7 6 5
3. Transport -- 4
2. Internet -- 3
1. Network Inerface  -- 2 1

7. Application - point of contact for all of the " Network aware" applications.
		ex. FTP, TFTP, SNMP, DNS,HTTP.

6. Presentation - "generify" data, encryption services.
	     - data converion, image , word 

5. Session -  creates and maintains sessions.
	- ex telnet and IE , seperates two sessions and maintain thems.
	- maintain different sessions.

layer 1 2 3 4 are critical, 5 6 7  layers are not so critical.

4. Transport - DATA Unit : Segment
	     - reliable - TCP(transmission Control Protocol)
	     - unreliable UPP(User Datagram Protocol)
	     - create a Port number
	     - each segments adds its own header to creat encapsulations
	     - UDP is faster, less overhead, realtime appication
	     - relaible needs to get acknowledgement for every segment that has been recieve.
	     - port number is a number that is attached with IP address to identify which 
	     to create a socket.
	     - socket is nothing but an ip address and port number.
	     - socket will be now send to the layer 3 Network.
             - also creat source port number.

3. Network - Data Unit: Packet
	   - IP Addressing Find the best path / Logical addressing
           
2. Data-link - Data Unit : Frame
	     - MAC Addressing 
	     - Error Checking
	     - hardware addressing
	     - burn in address/ it cannot be change
             - CRC Cyclic Redundancy check
             - parity check

1. Physical - DATA unit : Bit
	    - Actual Data Transfer
	    - check cables 

Data Sender
4. Transport : (TH : seg1)( TH " seg2)
3. Network : packet(NH : TH: seg1)
2. data link : frame(DH:(packet))
1. 0101010101010

Data reciever
1. 
2. dh:nh:th: seg
3. nh:th: seg
4. th: seg1 th: seg2 --  will wait until it gets all the segment
			combines
